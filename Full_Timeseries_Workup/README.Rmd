# Building One Continuous Time Series

As mentioned in the top-level README, slight differences in units and development stage classifications prevent a direct join of Gulf of Maine CPR data collected & stored by NOAA and its parallel data that is obtained from the Marine Biological Association (MBA).

This readme is intended to serve as a guide for how one might resolve these differences, and a record of some of the pitfalls a researcher one might encounter. As always, feedback and suggestions are welcome via github or by email.

### Loading NOAA and MBA Data

The data reshaping steps for working with these two data sources can be shown using data directly from ERDDAP. 

For user-convenience these steps have been detailed below:

**Necessary R Packages**

The following R packages and their uses are necessary for recreating the steps outlined in this README:

```{r}
library(targets)   # For loading data from targets workflow
library(tidyverse) # Data manipulation
library(rerddap)   # Accessing Data using ERDDAP API
library(worrms)    # Interface with WORMS and Aphia ID's

# helper for selecting thins "not in" a vector
`%nin%` <- function(x, table){ is.na(match(x, table, nomatch = NA_integer_))}

```


**Working from the {targets} pipeline**

```{r, eval = TRUE}

# Paths to targets instead of ERDDAP:

#---- NOAA Sourced Years ----#
withr::with_dir(
  rprojroot::find_root('_targets.R'),         
  tar_load("noaa_zp_erddap"))


# Reformat data types for later
noaa_zp <- noaa_zp_erddap %>% 
  mutate(
    transect_number = as.character(transect_number),
    abundance = as.numeric(abundance))


#---- MBA Sourced Years ----#
withr::with_dir(
  rprojroot::find_root('_targets.R'), 
  tar_load("mba_zpe_erddap"))
withr::with_dir(
  rprojroot::find_root('_targets.R'), 
  tar_load("mba_zpt_erddap"))

# Shorten the MBA names
mba_zpt <- mba_zpt_erddap
mba_zpe <- mba_zpe_erddap


# Toss the original targets
rm(noaa_zp_erddap, mba_zpt_erddap, mba_zpe_erddap)
```


**Working from the ERDDAP Uploads**

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# 1. NOAA Zooplankton
# Get the tabledap information from the server link and dataset_id
cpr_info <- info(
  url = "http://ismn.erddap.neracoos.org/erddap", 
  datasetid = "noaa_gom_cpr_zooplankton")

# Use the tabledap function to import all the data (optionally add filters)
noaa_zp <- tabledap(cpr_info)

# Reformat data types for later
noaa_zp <- noaa_zp %>% 
  mutate(
    transect_number = as.character(transect_number),
    abundance = as.numeric(abundance))


# 2. MBA Traverse
cpr_info <- info(
  url = "http://ismn.erddap.neracoos.org/erddap", 
  datasetid = "mba_gom_cpr_traverse")
mba_zpt <- tabledap(cpr_info)

# 2. MBA Eyecount
cpr_info <- info(
  url = "http://ismn.erddap.neracoos.org/erddap", 
  datasetid = "mba_gom_cpr_eyecount")
mba_zpe <- tabledap(cpr_info)

```

# Prepare MBA Data

Since the NOAA dataset contains the bulk of the ~50 year history for this CPR transect it is easiest to coerce the few years of the MBA data into a format that matches that of the NOAA data



## 1. Combine Zooplankton Data from MBA

Data from the MBA preserves the two measurement scales that the zooplankton data is recorded in which relate to the overall size of the zooplankton taxa. To get total zooplankton abundances we need to first combine the "eyecount" and "traverse" data into one zooplankton abundance dataset.

In general there is very little overlap where a taxon would be "double-counted", making this step a simple append. As a check against instances where there may be abundance data at both scales, I rename the columns before joining them to preserve the source scale. Then I can total the abundances to get an aggregate total (typically this step does not change the values as x + 0 = x)

```{r}

# The original code was in its wide-format, and with that format the metadata was in the first ten columns

# What we can do instead with the long format is rename abundance and abundance_per_transect of the one of them, merge, then add them to get totals
mba_eye <- rename(
  .data = mba_zpe,
  abund_eyecount = abundance, 
  transect_abund_eyecount = abundance_per_transect)
mba_trav <- rename(
  .data = mba_zpt, 
  abund_traverse = abundance, 
  transect_abund_traverse = abundance_per_transect)
 
# Once the abundance columns are no longer in conflict we can merge them on taxa_id numbers etc.
mba_zp <- full_join(
  x = mba_trav, 
  y = mba_eye, 
  by = c("cruise", "transect_number", "time", "latitude", "longitude", "pci", "taxon", "mba_id") # Erddap names
)
 

# Total the abundances from traverse and eyecount scales where possible
mba_zp <- mba_zp %>% 
  mutate(
    # Replace NA values with zeros
    abund_eyecount          = ifelse(is.na(abund_eyecount), 0, abund_eyecount),
    transect_abund_eyecount = ifelse(is.na(transect_abund_eyecount), 0, transect_abund_eyecount),
    abund_traverse          = ifelse(is.na(abund_traverse), 0, abund_traverse),
    transect_abund_traverse = ifelse(is.na(transect_abund_traverse), 0, transect_abund_traverse),
    # Sum them to get total abundances
    abundance_per_transect = transect_abund_traverse + transect_abund_eyecount,
    abundance              = abund_traverse + abund_eyecount) 

# Now drop the columns used as stand-ins 
# for combining the measurement scales
mba_zp <- mba_zp %>% 
  select(-c(abund_eyecount, abund_traverse, transect_abund_eyecount, transect_abund_traverse))
 


# Clean up environment
rm(mba_zpt, mba_zpe, mba_eye, mba_trav)
```


At this point we now have one dataframe containing the zooplankton abundance data from each of the two data sources.


## 2. Separate Stage Info from MBA Zooplankton Taxon Names

The MBA data comes with the taxonomic name and the development stage information stored in the same field. To increase the usability and create the ability to query specific groups, it helps to separate these to pieces of information.



```{r}
# Use function to split the taxon from the stages:
source(here::here("targets_r/targets_support.R"))

# Function iterates on each word in the MBA taxon names to flag when the taxon name ends and stage info begins
mba_stages <- separate_taxastage(mba_zp)

rm(mba_zp)
```



# Match Taxon to Aphia ID's

Now that there exists a combined zooplankton abundance table for both NOAA and MBA data, the next step is to ensure that the taxonomic name and development stages can be added together for a proper estimation of abundances.

Throughout the time series there is an inevitable variance in skill level and expertise among researchers. This variability in confidently and accurately identifying taxa and their correct life-stage has resulted in some inconsistent groupings through time. When looking at the overall community it is often not necessary to have the exact life stage identified, and a more relaxed characterization will suffice.

The next two sections detail the history and nuances of the different data sources, and some code to supplement each one to make a more user-friendly product.



## MBA Taxonomic ID's

The identifiers used by the MBA are from the [Aphia Taxonomic Platform](https://www.marinespecies.org/about.php#what_is_aphia), and the [World Register of Marine Species](https://www.marinespecies.org/about.php#what_is_worms). This resource has an R package: [{worrms}](https://github.com/ropensci/worrms) that can be used to look up taxonomic ID numbers from their names.

```{r}
# Q1: is the id number an aphia ID? NO

# Can we get the Aphia ID anyways, mostly
mba_aphia <- mba_stages %>% 
  split(.$taxon) %>% 
  imap_dfr(function(x, y){
    # Attempt to gain Aphia ID using lookup:
    aphia_id = try(
      expr = wm_name2id(name = y), 
      silent = TRUE)
    
    # If unsuccessful fill with NA
    aphia_id <- ifelse(class(aphia_id) == "try-error", NA, aphia_id)
    x_out <- mutate(x, aphia_id = aphia_id, .after = "mba_id")
    return(x_out)}) %>% 
  arrange(time, cruise, transect_number, taxon)

rm(mba_stages)

```

From here the MBA data has both the taxonomic information about identity and stage of the organisms counted by the CPR programme.


##  NOAA Taxonomic ID's

Data in the NOAA database uses identification ID's that are consistent with its [MARMAP Program](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/monitoring-decade-learning-about-future-past#:~:text=The%20%E2%80%9CMARMAP%20Decade%E2%80%9D%20ran%20from,the%20Northeast%20Fisheries%20Science%20Center.), a shelf-wide monitoring program that ran from 1977-1988.

These codes identify each taxon specifically, with an additional code for what development stage it exhibits. These are useful for organization within the NOAA database, but less so for working externally to that system. To create a more accessible dataset these will be swapped out for Aphia ID's using the same process as the MBA data:


```{r}
# Do the same Aphia ID Check for the NOAA taxa
noaa_aphia <- noaa_zp %>% 
  split(.$taxon) %>% 
  imap_dfr(function(x, y){
    # Attempt to gain Aphia ID using lookup:
    aphia_id = try(
      expr = wm_name2id(name = y), 
      silent = TRUE)
    
    # If unsucessful, fill with NA
    aphia_id <- ifelse(class(aphia_id) == "try-error", NA, aphia_id)
    x_out <- mutate(x, aphia_id = aphia_id, .after = "marmap_stage")
    return(x_out)}) %>% 
  arrange(time, cruise, transect_number, taxon)


rm(noaa_zp)
```


# Creating One Continuous Time Series

At this stage we have two groups of data, one from NOAA & two years of data from the Marine Biological Association. These datasets have been modified to contain consistent units and augmented with Aphia identification numbers for each taxon.

From here, we just need to drop columns that we no longer need. Then there a few minor tweaks where text strings are changed to be consistent, and where `NA` information with fill values of `-9999` are replaced for true `NA`'s.

### Select Columns that are Consistent

At this step I am choosing to drop columns like the MARMAP ID's because they are not of much value and have replaced with Aphia ID's

```{r}
# Drop columns that only apply to one data set or the other:
mba_prepped <- mba_aphia %>% select(-c(mba_id, abundance_per_transect))
noaa_prepped <- noaa_aphia %>% select(-c(marmap_code, marmap_stage))

rm(noaa_aphia, mba_aphia)
```

### Tidy up Text Inconsistencies

Throughout the data there exists an inconsistent use/inclusion of things like parentheses `(` or descriptive words like `copepodite`. To effectively query these groups which otherwise would be equivalent, it helps to make these as consistent as possible.

```{r}
# Add copepodite to stage number 
# Remove redundant text or parentheses
copepodite_stages <- tibble::tribble(
  ~"taxon_stage",          ~"stage_clean",
  #----------------------|--------------------
  "i-iv",                  "copepodite i-iv",
  "v-vi unidentified",     "copepodite v-vi",
  "(v-vi) (unidentified)", "copepodite v-vi",
  "(total)",               "total",
  "total (trial)",         "total",
  "larvae (total)",        "larvae",
  "larvae (unidentified)", "larvae",
  "(unidentified)",        NA
)

# More efficient with ifelse replacements
mba_stage_tidy <- mba_prepped %>%   
  mutate(
    taxon_stage = ifelse(taxon_stage == "i-iv", "copepodite i-iv", taxon_stage),
    taxon_stage = ifelse(taxon_stage == "v-vi unidentified", "copepodite v-vi", taxon_stage),
    taxon_stage = ifelse(taxon_stage == "(v-vi) (unidentified)", "copepodite v-vi", taxon_stage),
    taxon_stage = ifelse(taxon_stage == "(total)", "total", taxon_stage),
    taxon_stage = ifelse(taxon_stage == "total (trial)", "total", taxon_stage),
    taxon_stage = ifelse(taxon_stage == "larvae (total)", "larvae", taxon_stage),
    taxon_stage = ifelse(taxon_stage == "larvae (unidentified)", "larvae", taxon_stage),
    taxon_stage = ifelse(taxon_stage == "(unidentified)", NA, taxon_stage),
    # Cfin is not given a stage, but since it is only ID'd as 
    # an adult stages we can presume V-VI
    taxon_stage = ifelse(taxon == "Calanus finmarchicus", "copepodite v-vi", taxon_stage)
  )

#rm(mba_prepped)
```

### Make NA's Explicit

In the notes from the NOAA data it is stated that abundance values of `-9999` are used when a taxon is identified but no abundance is given. To safeguard against these being averaged into estimates, these have been replaced with true `NA` values.


```{r}
# Drop data with caveats or incorrect/missing information
noaa_prepped <- noaa_prepped %>% 
  mutate(abundance = ifelse(abundance == -9999, NA, abundance))
```


### Merge Data Sources

Finally we get to a point where columns are aligned, carrying the same information in the same forms.

```{r}
# Format column types for merge
mba_stage_tidy <- mutate(mba_stage_tidy, pci = as.character(pci))

# Append full timeseries
gulfofmaine_full <- bind_rows(noaa_prepped, mba_stage_tidy) %>% 
  mutate(taxon_stage = ifelse(is.na(taxon_stage), "unstaged", taxon_stage))

```

# Saving a Single Time Series

The data at this point has had a few minor cosmetic changes, and a handful of find & replace swaps for text consistencies, but is otherwise true to its original form. The following table details what columns are present, and what information they contain. This information will be mirrored by the ERDDAP metadata.

**NOTE:** For code used to repeat the processs for phytoplankton, refer to `Full_Timeseries_Workup/R/phytoplankton_timeseries_processing.R`.

## Full Timeseries Data Dictionary:

Once these steps are complete the data is now in a single table spanning the full time period. Definitions of the different columns are as follows:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
columns_meta <- tibble::tribble(
  ~"Column",         ~"Definition",
  #-----------------|--------------
  "cruise",          "Identification code for the ship passage through the region.",
  "transect_number", "Transect number sampled during the cruise",
  "time",            "Date-time of the midpoint of the transect",
  "latitude",        "Latitude coordinate of the center of the transect",
  "longitude",       "Longitude coordinate of the center of the transect",
  "pci",             "Phytoplankton color index",
  "taxon",            "Taxonomic identification",
  "taxon_stage",     "Development stage identification if given",
  "aphia_id",        "Aphia Identification number",
  "abundance",       "Estimated abundance in # per 100 meters cubed of water"
)


# Display table
columns_meta %>% knitr::kable()
```

### Showcase: Average Densities of C. Fin

From this point it is fairly straightforward to select a taxon of interest and check its abundances. The biggest pitfall/disclaimer to highlight however is that there is some inconsistency through time with the `taxon_stage`. Whenever in doubt it is always possible to operate on the `taxon` level.


```{r, fig.height=4}
gulfofmaine_full %>% 
  filter(taxon %in% c("Calanus", "Calanus finmarchicus")) %>% 
  group_by(year = lubridate::year(time), taxon) %>% 
  summarise(mean_abundance = mean(abundance, na.rm = T),
            .groups = "drop") %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, mean_abundance)) +
  geom_line(size = 0.5, linetype = 3) +
  geom_point(size = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~taxon, ncol = 1, scale = "free") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Average Abundance / 100m3")
```


## Saving the Single Timeseries

Because these steps for preparing the data contain some decision making on how strings are formatted and how to encode `NA` values these steps were not included in the primary pipeline. However, because of its ease of use advantages this full time series has been added to ERDDAP as well.

```{r}
# Change units of longitude to place them in correct hemisphere:
# This is done prior to putting on ERDDAP
gulfofmaine_full <- gulfofmaine_full %>%  
  mutate(longitude = ifelse(longitude > 0, longitude *-1, longitude))

# Save it
write_csv(gulfofmaine_full, here::here("erddap_ready", "gom_cpr_zooplankton_full.csv"))
```


---

# Extras

As mentioned previously, sometimes there is a need to get abundance for particular stages (or range of stages) through time. In order to do so, one must resolve them to a less-precise grouping that will capture groups of stages that may have phased in-and-out of use through time.

## Simplifying Development Stages

The following approach is one possible solution for an ease-of-use change to simplify the development stages of zooplankton into early stage (copepodite stages I-IV) and late stage (copepodite stages V-VI). 

What this step accomplished is it eliminates any circumstance where certain specific stages or groups of stages that were used in the past but inconsistently. There is a slight loss in resolution, but these functional groupings aid in ease-of-use and have been used in the literature.

In addition to increasing the ease of use, many of these labels exist in the data, but without abundances associated with them. This step aims to coalesce them into the groups that were actually used.

```{r, echo = FALSE}

# Function to plot the prevalance of taxon_stage labels in time:
check_stage_use <- function(taxa_id){
  taxa_presence <- gulfofmaine_full %>% 
  filter(taxon == taxa_id) %>% 
  group_by(year = lubridate::year(time), taxon_stage) %>% 
  summarise(abund = sum(abundance, na.rm = T),
                        .groups = "drop") %>%
  mutate(present = ifelse(abund > 0, "True", "False"),
         present = fct_rev(present))



taxa_presence %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = fct_rev(taxon_stage), fill = present)) +
    geom_tile() +
    gmRi::scale_fill_gmri() +
    labs(
      x = "Year",
      y = "Development Stage Label",
      title = taxa_id,
      subtitle = "Use of development stage ID's through time",
      fill = "Stage in use?"
    ) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
}
```

One example where this is somewhat straightforward is C. finmarchicus:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=3.5}

check_stage_use("Calanus finmarchicus")

```

An example that is less obvious how to proceed with might be C. typicus. In this example, beginning around 1985 and for whatever reason, instead of recording C. typicus under `copepodite IV-VI`, abundances were now being allocated to stages `IV-V` or just `VI`.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 3.5}
check_stage_use("Centropages typicus")
```

There are a handful of instances where the original taxon stage that is assigned, is a group that spans this early-late distinction that we might desire. For these instances the original range is preserved but with additional text removed.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Make a key that we can iterate over them
stage_reduce_key <- list(
  # "taxon_stage",   "stage_group",
  #--------------|---------------- 
  "adult"                   = "adult",                                        
  "adult atlantic"          = "adult",
